## Particle Simulator
This VI features a particle simulator with a central force that can be chosen- either a Coulomb (1/r^2) force, or a spring (-kx^2) force, both with an adjustable force constant. An directional force can be toggled on or off. A drag force (proportional to speed) can be toggled on or off, with an adjustable drag coefficient.

Currently, the program's display function is being fixed to account for a 'snake' of trailing data points.
