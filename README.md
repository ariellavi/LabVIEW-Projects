# LabVIEW-Projects
Random projects and programs running on LabVIEW.

## Particle Simulator
This VI features a particle simulator with a central force that can be chosen- either a Coulomb (1/r^2) force, or a spring (-kx^2) force, both with an adjustable force constant. An directional force can be toggled on or off. A drag force (proportional to speed) can be toggled on or off, with an adjustable drag coefficient.

Currently, the program's display function is being fixed to account for a 'snake' of trailing data points.

## Soundboard
A program with user interface controls that allows the user to record sound bites, play back at variable speed, play backwards, and save the modified sound file (or the original recording). In addition, the program can load a sound file (.wav) and modify it as mentioned above.
